# msl09's Jupyter Notebooks

This is my personal jupyter-notebooks project, presented on github for ease of
sharing.

Copyright to all notebooks(.pynb files) belongs to the author(usually
me), code snippets can be shared freely with no need to refer back to the
author(when the author is me). The history is an autocommited mess, don't look in there.
